# Blog_Website_prototype
A Blogging website prototype which will enable you to add your daily life experiences and allow you to share them with the world. There is a basic functionality associated with the application, through which user can click on post button and give a particular header to their post and then add the content appropriate to it. the post will get displayed on the home screen to certain word limit, as I have used lodash npm library of NODE.js. with a read more buitton associated to the post that can reduce the crowd over the home webpage and at the same time will not restrict user's actions and that post can be viewed by clicking on the read more button. Once, the user clicks the read more button, the post will open acquiring the entire screen for better usability. I have used ejs templates which eventually reduced my code size and enable me to use my header and footer again and again in different webpages, thus, reducing the code size along with the file size. All the basic operations over the webpage will be performed on the server side of the webpage and enables us to sepearte the user view with the functionality of the webpage.
